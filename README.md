# updateSqlServerSchema
Simple batch file to make use of Microsoft's SqlPackage command to generate a script to update one Sql Server schema to another.

You will need the command itself - details are at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlpackage?view=sql-server-2017

This is an alternative to the commercial tools available, which, while excellent and much more fully featured, are not always available.
